## **TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION: MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD EVERY DAY**

If you’ve ever felt that politicians don’t listen to you or that your anger is being ignored, this guide will help you take direct action to force them to pay attention. The most effective way to do that? Calls and face-to-face interactions.

#### **Why Calls Matter More Than You Think**

It’s easy to feel like your voice doesn’t matter, especially when the system seems rigged or when politicians seem to listen only to corporate donors. Here’s the reality: they do listen to voters—specifically, voters who won’t stop making noise. Right now, Republican voters have mastered this game.

Republicans are louder, more persistent, and more consistent when contacting their representatives. Studies, polls, and congressional staff reports all show that Republicans outnumber Democrats in calls to Congress—sometimes by as much as 4 to 1 or even 11 to 1 on hot-button issues. And it’s not just about quantity; Republican callers tend to be more aggressive, make daily follow-up calls, and ensure their presence is unmistakable.

#### **Why This Needs to Change**

This imbalance has real consequences. When Republicans flood congressional offices with calls about issues like blocking gun safety laws or cutting healthcare funding, it influences how politicians vote. Even lawmakers who might be on the fence often lean right because they see overwhelming opposition from their constituents. That’s why Republican voter turnout, call volume, and persistence give them a massive advantage in today’s political climate.

**Example:** Imagine your representative is undecided on a key vote, such as expanding access to abortion. They receive 300 calls from anti-abortion activists and only 30 from pro-choice constituents. Even if the representative is personally pro-choice, the pressure to vote against expanding access can be overwhelming.

Right now, we’re facing critical battles on voting rights, reproductive healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, climate change, gun reform, and the very nature of our democracy. We can’t afford to sit back while the loudest voices drown out the majority of Americans. We need to ensure that Democrats, Independents, and progressives are just as loud—or even louder.

#### **The Good News: You Don’t Have to Be As Loud and Obnoxious As Republicans**

Let’s be clear: you don’t need to scream or be rude to make an impact. What you need is consistency and persistence. Call every day, show up at events, and keep the pressure on—because it’s the volume of calls that matters, not the volume of your voice.

This guide will show you exactly how to level the playing field by:

* **Calling both Democrats and Republicans** and tailoring your message.  
* **Adapting scripts to resonate with conservative values** when contacting Republican representatives.  
* **Attending town halls and visiting local offices** to ask tough questions.  
* **Making calling a habit** that you and your friends can maintain.

We’re going to out-organize, out-call, and outlast them—because our lives and rights depend on it. If Republicans have been calling four times as much, let’s work together to close that gap.

### **1\. SHOW UP IN PERSON WHENEVER YOU CAN**

Face-to-face time with your representative or their staff is **the gold standard**; nothing beats an in-person encounter. Here’s why:

* **They Can’t Ignore You:** In-person interactions are harder to dismiss than an email or social media post.  
* **You Get Real Answers:** While politicians are trained to offer non-answers over the phone or online, a face-to-face meeting allows you to follow up on tough questions.  
* **They Remember You:** Consistently showing up makes you a recognizable face, and they’re more likely to take you seriously.

**Where to go:**

* **Town Halls:** These are public meetings where representatives answer questions from constituents. You can usually find dates on their official websites.  
* **Mobile Offices:** Many representatives send staff to different areas in their district to meet with people. Call their local office to find out when these happen.  
* **Local Offices:** Your congressperson’s local office is staffed with people who work directly for them. You don’t need an appointment to stop by and express your concerns.

**Tip:** Show up with others. The more people who attend, the harder it is for them to ignore the issue.

---

### **2\. MAKE CALLING PART OF YOUR DAILY ROUTINE**

**Calls are the most effective way to influence your representatives.** Here's why:

* **Detailed Logs:** Staffers log every call by topic, location, and zip code.  
* **Daily Reports:** Senior staff compile reports on the top issues being called about each day.  
* **Direct Impact:** These reports are sent directly to elected officials, clearly showing which issues voters care about and where the pressure is coming from.

When representatives see consistent surges in calls **especially from their own constituents** they pay attention. They know these calls represent votes, and that their jobs depend on responding to this pressure.

---

### **Why Calls Work Better Than Emails or Letters:**

* **Immediate Impact:** Calls create real-time pressure. If a vote is imminent, a flood of calls can tip the balance.  
* **Higher Visibility:** Emails often get filtered or ignored, and letters are too slow to effect immediate change.

### **Goal: Make at Least 6 Calls a Day**

**Why 6 calls?** You want to target both the **DC and local offices** of your Senators and Representative, ensuring your message is heard at multiple levels. But depending on your representative, there may be **additional satellite offices** in your district that you can call for even more impact.

Here’s the basic breakdown:

* **Senators:** Make 2 calls for each of your Senators—one to their DC office and one to their primary local office.  
  * Find their contact information: [Senators Contact List](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)  
* **Representative:** Make 2 calls to your Representative—one to their DC office and one to their primary local office.  
  * Find their contact information: [Find Your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)  
* **Additional Offices:** If your representatives have satellite offices, consider calling them as well. These offices may not handle every issue, but they log every call and report back to the main office, boosting your overall impact.  
* **Bonus:** Call your **governor’s office** too\! Governors often play key roles in enforcing or blocking state-level policies.  
  * Find your governor’s contact info: [State Governors](https://www.usa.gov/state-governor)

**More calls \= more pressure.** Don’t stop at 6 if you have time to contact additional offices.

### **How to Organize Your Contacts:**

1. **Label Your Contacts:**   
   Save phone numbers in your phone with clear labels. I like to recommend   
* P Sen \<firstname\> \<lastname\> → Senator  
* P Rep \<firstname\> \<lastname\> → House Representative  
* P Gov \<firstname\> \<lastname\> → Governor   
  **Why this format?** The **P** groups all political contacts together in your contact list, making them easy to find. The **Sen**, **Rep**, and **Gov** tags quickly show you the role of each contact without needing to search further.

2. **Include Office Locations:**   
   Each office (DC, state, or district) will have its own phone number for each contact entry. Label them by location (e.g., "DC Office," "Boston Office") so you can quickly call the right one.

3. **Set a Daily Reminder:**   
   Whether it’s during breakfast or on your lunch break, treat calling as a non-negotiable daily habit.

**Tip:** Even if you get voicemails, leave messages. Staffers will still log the call.

**Bonus Tip:** If you have anxiety about talking to someone on the phone, call after 5pm when you will most likely get picked up by an answering machine.

### **3\. USE 5 CALLS TO FIND ISSUES AND TARGETS**

A slow trickle of scattered calls with no clear message doesn’t make an impact. In contrast, a coordinated push—a high volume of calls in a short period, all delivering a focused message—creates real pressure on decision-makers. That’s where [**5 Calls**](https://5calls.org) comes in. Not only does it provide comprehensive contact information and suggested scripts for your Senators, Representative, and governor, but it also helps unite all users under one clear message. By using 5 Calls, you’re not just reaching out individually; you’re creating a unified voice that signals the top issues in your community and amplifies your collective impact.

Here’s how it works:

* **Key Issues Automatically Listed:** It identifies the most urgent issues based on your location, ensuring everyone is talking about the same priorities.  
* **Comprehensive Contact Information:** It provides the names and phone numbers for your key elected officials, including multiple offices if available.  
* **Suggested Scripts:** It offers tailored scripts so that every call is focused and consistent, helping you deliver that coordinated push.

**Why 5 Calls is essential:** Many representatives have multiple district offices, and 5 Calls ensures you don’t miss any opportunity to make contact. By following its guidance, you’ll be reaching out to the right people about the most relevant issues.

**Tip:** If 5 Calls suggests an office you didn’t know about, save that number in your phone so it’s ready for future calls.

With **consistent, strategic calling**, we can level the playing field and ensure our voices are just as loud—if not louder—than those on the other side.

### **4\. CRAFT AN EFFECTIVE SCRIPT FOR EACH CALL**

**Preparation is key.** Before you call, take a few moments to think about what you’re going to say unless you are using a script from 5 calls. Here’s how to do it:

#### **A Simple Script Template:**

1. Introduce yourself.

   * Example: “Hi, my name is \[Your Name\], and I’m a constituent from \[Your City/State/Zip Code\].”  
2. Say why you’re calling.

   * Example: “I’m calling to express my concern/support regarding \[specific bill, issue, or policy\].”  
3. Make it personal.

   * Example: “As a teacher, I see firsthand how this bill will impact our schools.”  
   * OR: “As someone who lost a family member to gun violence, I’m asking you to vote for stricter background checks.”  
4. Be clear about what you want.

   * Example: “I urge the Senator to vote YES on \[Bill Number\].”  
   * OR: “I want the Representative to publicly oppose the proposed cuts to Medicare.”

#### **Leave a Voicemail if Necessary:**

* If you can’t reach a live person, leave a concise voicemail following the same script.

**Tip:** You may want to practice your script out loud once before calling. It will help you sound more confident.

### **5\. DON’T JUST CALL DEMOCRATS—CALL REPUBLICANS TOO**

It’s tempting to only call representatives who align with your views, but **it’s just as important to call Republicans.** Why? Because in the current political landscape, **every vote counts more than ever, and Republicans are vulnerable.**

#### **The Slimmest Majorities Mean Maximum Leverage**

* **Republicans are starting 2025 with the smallest House majority since 1931\.** They currently have **219 sitting members**, just **one seat above the 218 required** to pass legislation. Democrats hold **215 seats** and there’s **one vacancy** (due to the resignation of former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz).  
* **In the Senate, Republicans also have a slim majority**, and there are several moderate Republicans who have shown a willingness to break ranks on key votes.  
* This means **just a few Republican defectors can block critical legislation or flip votes in favor of Democratic priorities.** When Republicans are divided, **we win.**

#### **Why Republicans Track Every Call**

Republican offices **log every call, even from voters who don’t share their ideology.** They care about **the volume of calls** because it reflects potential voting power in their district or state. Even if they disagree with your position, **they know ignoring large numbers of calls could cost them their seat.**

#### **How to Influence Republican Votes:**

You don’t need to convince them to change their beliefs—you just need them to feel enough pressure to **vote in your favor**.

### **How to Adjust Your Message for Republicans:**

1. **Focus on shared values:**  
   * Emphasize economic benefits, public safety, family stability, and similar priorities.  
2. **Frame Arguments Around Practical Concerns:**  
   * Republicans are more likely to respond to arguments framed around **jobs, small businesses, taxes, national security, and community well-being.**  
   * **Example:** “I’m concerned that this policy will hurt small businesses in our community by increasing costs.”  
   * **Example:** “Supporting this bill will help veterans by improving healthcare access and job opportunities.”  
3. **Highlight the Political Advantage:**  
   * Highlight how voting your way will help them politically—whether by **appealing to moderate voters** or demonstrating **bipartisanship.**  
   * **Example:** “Supporting this bill shows voters you’re willing to put the community’s needs above party loyalty, which will help you win reelection.”  
4. **Consider Positioning Yourself as a Republican Voter:**  
   * If you believe it will be more effective, **frame yourself as a conservative voter.** This tactic is about playing the game to influence the outcome.  
   * **Example:** “As a lifelong conservative, I believe in protecting our environment for future generations. Supporting clean energy projects will help businesses and farmers while preserving our way of life.”  
   * **Example:** “As a Republican voter, I value fiscal responsibility, and this bill will save taxpayer dollars while addressing the issue effectively.”

**Tip:** If you’re calling from a district that typically votes Republican, make sure to highlight your zip code to reinforce that you’re part of their constituency.

---

**Remember:** You’re not trying to change their ideology—you’re trying to change their vote. The goal is to convince them that voting your way aligns with their self-interest, whether that means retaining their seat, appealing to moderates, or showcasing bipartisan leadership. A few key defections can disrupt their unity and block harmful legislation.

By consistently applying pressure, we can create cracks in their unity, weaken their agenda, and push forward the change we need.

---

### **6\. FOCUS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES (1-2 PER DAY)**

When you call, don’t try to cover every issue you’re passionate about. Staffers typically log 1-2 topics per call, so concentrate on the most important issue for that day:

* **Prioritize Issues:** Focus on matters that are up for a vote or currently under debate.  
* **Long-Term Focus:** If nothing major is happening, call about long-term issues like climate change, healthcare or Project 2025\.  
* **Keep the Pressure On:** Even if you’ve called about the same issue before, continue calling until you see action.

**Tip:** Consistency is key—each call adds to the pressure.

---

### **7\. TRACK YOUR CALLS AND RESULTS (OPTIONAL)**

To stay motivated, **track your progress** using a journal, app, or simple checklist. Write down:

* **Who you called** and **what you said**.  
* **Their response** (if any).  
* **Any follow-up actions** you need to take.

Tracking helps you stay consistent and gives you a sense of accomplishment.

---

### **8\. BONUS: SHOW UP WITH FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY**

You don’t have to do this alone. Encourage friends, family, and community members to join you. Organize calling parties where you all call together—**strength in numbers can’t be ignored.**
